1) User signs up.

exports.newUser listens
to users/userid onCreate.

Creates a welcome message 
that is pushed to direct_messages/thread_id
(does this trigger another event???)

creates a nowMessaging object
with false new message and SETS
the users/userid/messaging/admin to 
this nowMessaging (admin/false
(does this trigger??))

in users/userid/last_message/userid
set to nowMessaging (admin/false)

// testing.
created jennifer.
kq8x...
messaging: admin
new message = true
last message: admin
Admin is messaging jennifer
admin has no last message. (bug to fix later)


....

now when i click on the item,
it should set the message new = false
through selectLastMessage action,
and pass back selectMEssage to UI to set state


selectLastMessage:
set in users/last_message to this message.
update users/uid/messaging/receiver for
newMessage: false.

update 
.....
now i think this triggers
exports.messageUser.

if it does then there should
be console.log of senderDoc/rsenderId/receiverId

messageUser:
 {
     if users/sender/messaging/receiver onCreate
     set users/receiver/messaging/sender 
     to sender
 }


 BUG: 
 Jeff messages jennifer
 and its new in jeffs message model.

 modal calls 
 addDirectMessage
 and
 messageUser
